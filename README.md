# FoundNotLost
During the IT Fundamentals course at the University of Cincinnati, Nathan was assigned to a group to create an app idea.
Nathan went above and beyond by making the app more than just an idea.

Found Not Lost is an iOS app that helps people return or find lost items.
The app was originally named iFound It. However, the name iFound It was already taken. The new name is Found Not Lost.
This app is functional. However, it currently needs improvement before being listed on the App Store.
